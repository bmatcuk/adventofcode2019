# Advent of Code, 2019 :christmas_tree:
My implementations of the [2019 Advent of Code] puzzles in [rust].

I like to use the Advent of Code as a learning opportunity. This year, I
decided on learning [rust]. I've had a little experience with the language
before AoC, but I really wanted to dive deeper into it.

Because I'm using this as an opportunity to learn rust, I've avoided any
external dependencies. I'm sure some of these puzzles could have been greatly
simplified by pulling in some external crate, but then I would be doing myself
a disservice.

As another benefit, my solutions are completely self-contained. Each day is in
their associated directory, and, within those directories, are `part1.rs` and
`part2.rs` files to solve the parts. These files have no external dependencies
whatsoever, not even to my own code. So, for someone who is having trouble
solving an AoC puzzle, you won't have to hunt around my repo or read crate
documentation to understand my solution; everything is in one file... though, I
can't speak much to my code quality =)
